# Introduction #
AusBubble is an open-source, open-hardware RF jammer designed to work in the 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi frequency block. Limor Fried's [Wave Bubble](http://www.ladyada.net/make/wavebubble/) served as the initial inspiration for this project, with the end-goal being a much improved design incorporating digital control and higher RF output power (>1W).
